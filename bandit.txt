I logged in using the password bandit0

Level 1:
Used ls and cat to get the password in the readme file: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

Level 2:
Used cat ./- to get pass: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

Level 3:
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Pass: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

Level 5:
I did this so inefficiently. I just did cat ./-file0[insert number] over and over again until this happened...
cat ./-file07
Pass: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

Level 6:
Cd inhere
Ls
Find . -size 1033c
Cd maybehere07
Cat ./.file2
Pass: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

Level 7:
$ find /  -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
Got a long list of files, and this one stood out: /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Pass: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

Level 8:
Probably not the way you are really supposed to do this but this is what I did
Ls
Cat data.txt
Command+f search for "millionth"
Password next to it was: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
Another way (and probably the "right" way) to do this would be to use this command:
grep 'millionth' data.txt
Either way the password is the same

Level 9:
sort data.txt | uniq -u

base64 -d data.txt

Level 12:
Had to google what to put as the operand in the tr function for ROT13
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
Pass: 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
