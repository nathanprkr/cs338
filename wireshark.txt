192.168.64.2  TCP 66 13 → 35094 [SYN, ACK]
129.6.15.28 TCP 54 35094 - 13 [ACK]
2:35094
3:the client needs a port to receive the data packets that the server is going to send over
4:192.168.64.2 DAYTIME 105
5:synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK)
6: the server initiated the close, because the [FIN, ACK] is sent from port 13 (the server port)

1: Seems like two, because I see two sets of SYN/SYN ACK/ACK lines 
2: 
I think it happens on the line provided below, because it is the one that contains the html text
172.233.221.124 192.168.64.2 HTTP 667 HTTP/1.1 200 OK (text/html)
3: after looking through all the lines, honestly I cant. I dont see anything that has any indication of requesting/passing an image.
